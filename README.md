# Punishing: Gray Raven Gacha Simulator
I mostly made this because I saw the Uma Musume one and got jealous lol

## Current State
- Themed Banner and Fate Themed Banner available (current/upcoming Construct for global servers: Bianca: Crepuscule for Through the Tide Home)
- Base Member Target with possible S-rank check up to Selena: Pianissimo

## Sources
- Huaxu
  - [Frame images](https://assets.huaxu.app/browse/cn/image/role/?layout=grid)
- [Gray Ravens](https://grayravens.com/wiki/GRAY_RAVENS)

## Current Issues
- I think the Themed Banner also gives debut unit shards? Unsure though (also I don't have the assets so I have to find a replacement image)
- Pulling too fast will make it bug out (duh don't do that)
- Gets a little slow because I think that's Streamlit latency (will look for a different place to host)

## TODO
- Update patch choices for future (Through the Tide Home, Woven Prologue, Ideal Cage)
- Veronica update

### Maybe
- Weapon banner (is going to be a pain because of the individual off-rates but surelyâ€”)
- CUB banner (this one is a little less pain but still)
