## Current Issues
- Windows doesn't show the star for 5-star/4-star/3-star weapon in test which... why....
- Pulling too fast will make it bug out (duh don't do that)
- Gets a little slow because I think that's Streamlit latency (will look for a different place to host)
- The A-rank check resets in Member Target if you swap patches (probably doesn't really matter but still)
- Future banners in IP don't give previous unit's shards (CUB and unit)
  - ~~But also I'm not sure how to do it so it might have to wait until sync~~
- Target weapon and arrival banner
  - Calibration exists but it's not visually there (because once it shows up it won't go away like what)
  - No uniqueness for five star and below weapons (~~but uh, do people really want to see what kind of five star they got?~~)

## TODO

- [ ] Move it to a more scalable platform
- [ ] Patch cleanup for post-integrated patches (also a general code cleanup to be honest)
