## Current Issues
- Pulling too fast will make it bug out (duh don't do that)
- Gets a little slow because I think that's Streamlit latency (will look for a different place to host)
- The A-rank check resets in Member Target if you swap patches (probably doesn't really matter but still)
- Future banners in IP don't give previous unit's shards (CUB and unit)
  - ~~But also I'm not sure how to do it so it might have to wait until sync~~
- Target banner
  - No calibration (Will get to it)
  - No uniqueness for five star and below weapons (~~but uh, do people really want to see what kind of five star they got?~~)

## TODO
- Base weapon banner

- Arrival banner
  - 70% target and other two target selectors (just to make it easier lol)
  - It probably starts from Scire because Daren is (somehow) not dead yet (maybe just add all S-ranks for the sake of me not figuring that out)
  - Make sure targeted is not selectable from the other 15%s
