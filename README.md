# Punishing: Gray Raven Gacha Simulator
I mostly made this because I saw the Uma Musume one and got jealous lol

## Current State

  - GLB Through the Tide Home integrated - Bianca: Crepuscule, Discord: Secator, and Veronica: Aegis
  - Through the Tide Home - Bianca: Crepuscule

## Current Issues
- Pulling too fast will make it bug out (duh don't do that)
- Gets a little slow because I think that's Streamlit latency (will look for a different place to host)
- The A-rank check resets in Member Target if you swap patches (probably doesn't really matter but still)
- Future banners in IP don't give previous unit's shards (CUB and unit)

## TODO
- Weapon banner (is going to be a pain because of the individual off-rates but surely—)

- Arrival banner
  - 70% target and other two target selectors (just to make it easier lol)
  - It probably starts from Scire because Daren is (somehow) not dead yet (maybe just add all S-ranks for the sake of me not figuring that out)
  - Make sure targeted is not selectable from the other 15%s
