# Punishing: Gray Raven Gacha Simulator
I mostly made this because I saw the Uma Musume one and got jealous lol

## Current State
- Organizable by patches
  - Through the Tide Home - Bianca: Crepuscule
  - Woven Prologue - Discord: Secator
  - GLB Through the Tide Home integrated - Bianca: Crepuscule and Discord: Secator
  - INCOMPLETE: Ideal Cage (PICTURES TEMPORARY UNTIL OFFICIAL RELEASE)
- Themed Banner and Fate Themed Banner available
- Base Member Target with possible S-rank check
- CUB banner

## Sources
- Huaxu
  - [Frame images](https://assets.huaxu.app/browse/cn/image/role/?layout=grid)
- [Gray Ravens](https://grayravens.com/wiki/GRAY_RAVENS)

## Current Issues
- I think the Themed/CUB on debut also gives debut unit/CUB shards? Unsure though (also I don't have the assets so I have to find a replacement image)
- Pulling too fast will make it bug out (duh don't do that)
- Gets a little slow because I think that's Streamlit latency (will look for a different place to host)
- The A-rank check resets in Member Target if you swap patches (probably doesn't really matter but still)
- I don't have assets for the Crepuscule+Noctiluca+Secator shards oops (also must update shards to keep track of if they're added or not)

## TODO
- Update patch choices for future (Woven Prologue+Ideal Cage IP for KR/JP, Liv patch)
- Veronica update (I'm missing assets help)
- Uniframes (unfinished)

### Maybe
- Weapon banner (is going to be a pain because of the individual off-rates but surelyâ€”)
- Uniframe banner (bruh)
- Arrival banner
  - 70% target and other two target selectors (just to make it easier lol)
  - It probably starts from Scire because Daren is (somehow) not dead yet (maybe just add all S-ranks for the sake of me not figuring that out)
  - Make sure targeted is not selectable from the other 15%s
